What does it do?
================

With checkfaluploads we will add a new checkboxes to filelist module and ElementBrowser
where the user gives unrestricted rights to the owner for the uploaded files.
Further the user UID will be added to the sys_file record, so an admin can see and filter files by
user UID.
