What does it do?
================

With checkfaluploads we will add a new checkbox to filelist module and ElementBrowser
where the user gives unrestricted rights to the owner for the uploaded files.
Further the UID of the image uploading editor will be added to the `sys_file` record, so an admin can see who has
uploaded a file in history.
